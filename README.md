SCOT IT Academy — Complete Site Explanation
1. What is this website?

The SCOT IT Academy Enquiry Follow-up System is an internal CRM/management system for an academy.

Its main purpose is:

New Enquiry
     ↓
Store Student/Enquiry Details
     ↓
Assign Admin / Branch
     ↓
Set Follow-up Date
     ↓
Follow-up with Candidate
     ↓
Update Status
     ↓
Candidate Joins
     ↓
Create Student
     ↓
Track Fees
     ↓
Reports / Dashboard

So this is not just a normal website.

It is an Enquiry → Follow-up → Admission → Student → Fee Management system.

2. Technology Architecture

Your project is divided into two major parts.

SCOT IT Academy
│
├── Frontend
│   └── React.js
│
└── Backend
    └── Node.js / Express
        │
        ├── JWT Authentication
        ├── REST API
        └── MySQL Database

The README describes the frontend as React and mentions that login can fall back to demo mode when the backend isn't running.

Your current backend source confirms MySQL tables and Express-style routes such as:

/api/dashboard
/api/enquiries
/api/follow-ups
/api/categories
/api/reports
/api/notifications
/api/settings

and these routes are protected by authentication.

3. Frontend

The frontend is the part the staff actually sees.

Your README lists these pages:

Dashboard
Add Enquiry
Enquiry List
Students
Follow-ups
Reports
Admins
Categories
Refer By
Settings

The general design is:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ SCOT IT ACADEMY                              │
├───────────────┬──────────────────────────────┤
│               │                              │
│ Dashboard     │                              │
│ Add Enquiry   │       PAGE CONTENT           │
│ Enquiry List  │                              │
│ Students      │                              │
│ Follow-ups    │                              │
│ Reports       │                              │
│ Admins        │                              │
│ Categories    │                              │
│ Refer By      │                              │
│ Settings      │                              │
│               │                              │
└───────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘

The README specifically says the original visual design is preserved with:

dark blue sidebar
white cards
statistic cards
tables
forms
badges
responsive breakpoints
student details modal
4. Login Page

The login page is the entrance to the application.

User enters:

Username
Password

Example:

Username: SCOT
Password: ********

Frontend sends:

POST /api/auth/login

The backend searches the users table by username.

Then it compares the entered password against the stored bcrypt password hash.

If valid:

Username
   ↓
Database
   ↓
bcrypt password check
   ↓
JWT generated
   ↓
User returned
   ↓
Frontend stores authentication
   ↓
Dashboard

Your current login route returns:

{
    access: "...JWT...",
    user: {
        id,
        username,
        name,
        role
    }
}

This is why your previous 401 Unauthorized was occurring: the backend could not find/validate the configured Owner account.

5. Owner and Admin System

There are two important roles:

Owner

The Owner is the highest-level account.

The Owner can manage:

Admins
Categories
Settings
Enquiries
Students
Reports
Admin

Admins handle enquiries and follow-ups.

Your backend has protected admin routes, including updating and deleting administrators. The delete-admin operation specifically requires ownerOnly.

So conceptually:

OWNER
  │
  ├── Create Admin
  ├── Edit Admin
  ├── Delete Admin
  ├── Manage Categories
  ├── Manage Settings
  └── View all system data
       │
       └── ADMIN
             ├── Enquiries
             ├── Follow-ups
             └── Students
6. Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first main page after login.

It gives a quick overview of the academy.

The backend calculates values including:

Total Students
Joined Students
Total Fee
Recent Enquiries
Follow-ups
Category statistics

The dashboard calculates total students and joined students directly from the students table and calculates total fees from total_fee.

It also retrieves recent enquiries with:

Admin
Candidate Name
Mobile
City
Category
Course
Next Follow-up
Status

So your dashboard can be thought of as:

┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dashboard                               │
├────────────┬────────────┬───────────────┤
│ Students   │ Joined     │ Total Fee     │
│    50      │    25      │ ₹5,00,000     │
├────────────┴────────────┴───────────────┤
│ Recent Enquiries                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Follow-ups                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Category Statistics                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
7. Add Enquiry

This is one of the most important pages.

When someone contacts SCOT IT Academy, staff creates an enquiry.

Typical information includes:

Branch
Admin
Enquiry Date
Candidate Name
Mobile
City
Degree
Passed Year
Category
Course
Comments
Next Follow-up Date
Status
Referred By
Referral Contact

The backend accepts these fields when creating an enquiry.

Example:

Branch: Keelkattalai
Admin: Bhuvaneshwari
Candidate: Arun
Mobile: 9876543210
City: Chennai
Degree: BCA
Passed Year: 2025
Category: Development
Course: Python Full Stack
Comments: Interested in weekend batch
Follow-up: 2026-09-12
Status: Positive
Referred By: Google

Then:

POST /api/enquiries

The backend saves it into MySQL.

8. Enquiry List

The Enquiry List displays all enquiries.

Example:

Candidate	Mobile	Course	Status	Follow-up
Arun	9876543210	Python Full Stack	Positive	12 Sep
Kumar	9876501234	Testing	Pending	13 Sep
Priya	9876512345	Data Analytics	Low	15 Sep

The backend endpoint is:

GET /api/enquiries

It returns enquiry information such as branch, admin, candidate, mobile, category, course, status and follow-up dates.

9. Edit Enquiry

Staff should be able to edit an enquiry.

For example:

Status:
Pending → Positive

Follow-up:
12 Sep → 15 Sep

Course:
Python → Python Full Stack

The backend updates fields including:

branch
admin
enquiry_date
candidate_name
mobile
city
degree
passed_year
category
course
comments
next_followup_date
status
referred_by
referral_contact

10. Follow-ups

The Follow-ups page is used by staff to know:

"Who should I contact today?"

The backend provides:

GET /api/follow-ups

It retrieves enquiries that are not Joined, sorted according to follow-up date.

Example:

TODAY'S FOLLOW-UPS

1. Arun
   Python Full Stack
   9876543210
   Follow-up: Today
   Status: Positive

2. Priya
   Data Analytics
   9876500000
   Follow-up: Today
   Status: Pending

This is essentially the CRM's daily task list.

11. Enquiry Status

Your system uses enquiry status to track the candidate journey.

For example:

Positive
Pending
Low
Hold
Negative
Joined

The important transition is:

New
 ↓
Pending
 ↓
Positive
 ↓
Joined

or:

New
 ↓
Pending
 ↓
Low

or:

New
 ↓
Positive
 ↓
Negative

When a candidate becomes Joined, they move into the student/admission side of the system.

The dashboard itself counts joined students using the joined status.

12. Students

The Students page contains people who have actually joined a course.

Typical information:

Student ID
Name
Course
Total Fee
Paid Fee
Balance
Due Date
Action

The system can therefore track:

Total Fee = ₹30,000

Paid = ₹15,000

Balance = ₹15,000

So:

Student
   ↓
Course
   ↓
Total Fee
   ↓
Paid Fee
   ↓
Balance Fee
   ↓
Due Date

The backend also uses student fee data for reports and dashboard calculations.

13. Student Details Modal

The README specifically mentions a student-details modal.

Instead of navigating to another page, clicking a student can open:

┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Student Details             X   │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Student ID: ST001               │
│ Name: Arun                      │
│ Mobile: 9876543210              │
│ Course: Python Full Stack       │
│ Total Fee: ₹30,000              │
│ Paid: ₹20,000                   │
│ Balance: ₹10,000                │
│ Due Date: 20 Sep 2026           │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

This keeps the interface faster for staff.

14. Reports

Reports give management a bigger picture.

The backend has:

GET /api/reports

It calculates:

Total Students
Total Enquiries
Total Revenue
Total Due
Category statistics

The backend calculates total revenue using students.total_fee and total outstanding using students.balance_fee.

So management can understand:

Total Enquiries       250
Total Students        100
Total Revenue         ₹25,00,000
Total Pending Fee     ₹4,50,000
15. Categories

Categories classify enquiries/courses.

Examples from your project:

Testing
Cloud
Development
Oracle SQL
UI/UX
Data Analytics
Data Science
Fresher Placement
Experienced Placement
Documents

The backend provides:

GET /api/categories

and:

POST /api/categories

Categories are stored in the categories table and returned ordered by name.

This means you don't need to hard-code every category permanently in React.

16. Admins

The Admins page is for managing staff accounts.

Example:

Admin Name       Username       Status
---------------------------------------
Praveen          praveen        Active
Bhuvaneshwari    bhuvana        Active
Kokila           kokila         Active
Dhana            dhana          Active
Swathy           swathy         Active

Owner can:

Create Admin
Edit Admin
Delete Admin

Admin passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes when updated.

17. Refer By

This page manages referral sources.

For example:

Google
Instagram
Facebook
WhatsApp
Friend
Existing Student
Walk-in
Website
Justdial

When an enquiry comes in:

Candidate: Arun
Referred By: Google

The system can therefore measure which sources generate enquiries.

The enquiry database includes both:

referred_by
referral_contact

fields.

18. Settings

Settings controls academy-level configuration.

The backend provides:

GET /api/settings

and:

PATCH /api/settings

Settings are stored in a MySQL settings table using:

setting_key
setting_value
updated_at

Conceptually:

Settings
│
├── Institute Name
├── Contact Information
├── Email
├── Branch
├── Notification Settings
└── Other Application Configuration
19. Notifications

The system also has a notifications API:

GET /api/notifications

The backend checks students who have:

due_date < today
AND
balance_fee > 0

These are returned as due-fee notifications.

So the application can show something like:

🔔 Notifications

3 students have pending fees

• Arun - ₹10,000
• Priya - ₹5,000
• Kumar - ₹8,000
20. Database Structure

The overall database concept is approximately:

users
│
├── Owner
└── Admins

categories
│
└── Course Categories

enquiries
│
├── Candidate information
├── Follow-up information
├── Status
└── Referral information

students
│
├── Student information
├── Course
├── Fees
└── Due date

settings
│
└── Academy configuration

notifications
│
└── Due/payment notifications

The backend source confirms tables such as settings and notifications, including notification links to students.

22. API Architecture

Your current backend follows this pattern:

React
  │
  │ Axios
  ↓
Express API
  │
  ├── Authentication
  ├── Authorization
  ├── Business Logic
  ↓
MySQL

Example:

React
  │
  │ GET /api/enquiries
  ↓
Express
  │
  │ JWT authentication
  ↓
MySQL
  │
  │ SELECT ...
  ↓
Express
  │
  ↓
React
23. Authentication

Your protected API structure is important.

For example:

app.get(
  "/api/enquiries",
  auth,
  async (...)
)

This means:

Request
   ↓
auth middleware
   ↓
JWT valid?
   ├── NO → 401
   │
   └── YES
        ↓
     Database

That's why your earlier browser error was:

POST /api/auth/login
401 Unauthorized

A 401 from the login route means the credentials were not accepted—not that React itself failed.

24. Your Current Deployment Problem

From the backend file I inspected, I found a very important issue.

Your file has:

startServer();

near the first startup section and then another:

startServer();

near the bottom.

The file therefore starts the server twice. The first startup succeeds, then the second attempts to listen on the same port and produces:

EADDRINUSE
0.0.0.0:10000

The source contains one startup call around lines 1164 and another around line 1210.

There is also another duplicate startup block later in the same source, confirming that this file has duplicated backend sections.

Therefore your Render issue is:
Problem 1
OWNER_USERNAME / OWNER_PASSWORD
        ↓
not reaching Node process

Problem 2
startServer()
        ↓
called multiple times
        ↓
EADDRINUSE
25. Correct Production Architecture

For your current project, I recommend this final architecture:

SCOT IT Academy

        ├── reports
        ├── admins
        ├── categories
        ├── notifications
        └── settings
26. Frontend → Backend connection

Your production React frontend should use:

https://scot-it-academy-node.onrender.com

Then:

Login
/api/auth/login

Dashboard
/api/dashboard

Enquiries
/api/enquiries

Follow-ups
/api/follow-ups

Reports
/api/reports

Categories
/api/categories

Settings
/api/settings

Notifications
/api/notifications

The frontend should attach the JWT to protected requests:

Authorization: Bearer <JWT>

              ▼
          MANAGEMENT
In simple words

This entire site is an academy CRM.

It takes a person from:

Enquiry → Follow-up → Positive → Joined → Student → Fee Tracking → Reports.

And the Owner/Admin system controls who can access and manage that information.
